\title{Plot Jaccard subgroup similarity index (SSI) for causal distillation tree objects}
\usage{
plot_jaccard(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Two or more causal distillation tree objects, each is typically
the output of \code{\link{causalDT}}. Arguments should be named (so that
they are properly labeled in the resulting plot).}
}
\value{
A plot of the Jaccard SSI for each tree depth.
}
\description{
The Jaccard subgroup similiarity index (SSI) is a measure of the
similarity between two candidate partitions of subgroups. To select an
appropriate teacher model in CDT, the Jaccard SSI can be used to select the
teacher model that recovers the most stable subgroups.

\examples{
n <- 50
p <- 2
X <- matrix(rnorm(n * p), nrow = n, ncol = p)
Z <- rbinom(n, 1, 0.5)
Y <- 2 * Z * (X[, 1] > 0) + X[, 2] + rnorm(n, 0.1)

cdt1 <- causalDT(X, Y, Z)
cdt2 <- causalDT(X, Y, Z, teacher_model = rboost)
plot_jaccard(`Causal Forest` = cdt1, `Rboost` = cdt2)
