\arguments{
\item{X}{A tibble, data.frame, or matrix of covariates.}

\item{Y}{A vector of outcomes.}

\item{Z}{A vector of treatments.}

\item{holdout_prop}{Proportion of data to hold out for honest estimation of
treatment effects. Used only if \code{holdout_idxs} is NULL.}

\item{holdout_idxs}{A vector of indices to hold out for honest estimation of
treatment effects. If NULL, a holdout set of size \code{holdout_prop} x nrow(X)
is randomly selected.}

\item{teacher_model}{Teacher model used to estimate individual-level
treatment events. Should be either "causal_forest" (default) or a function.
If "causal_forest", \code{grf::causal_forest()} is used as the teacher
model. Otherwise, the function should take in the named arguments
\code{X}, \code{Y}, \code{Z}, (corresponding to the covariates, outcome, and treatment
data, respectively) as well as (optional) additional arguments passed to
the function via \code{...}. Moreover, the function should return a model object
that can be used to predict individual-level treatment effects using
\code{teacher_predict(teacher_model, x)}.}

\item{teacher_predict}{Function used to predict individual-level treatment
effects from the teacher model. Should take in two arguments. as input: the
first being the model object returned by \code{teacher_model}, and the second
being a tibble, data.frame, or matrix of covariates. If \code{NULL}, the
default is \code{predict()}.}

\item{student_model}{Student model used to estimate subgroups of individuals
and their corresponding estimated treatment effects. Should be either
"rpart" (default) or a function. If "rpart", \code{rpart::rpart()} is used.
Otherwise, the function should take in two arguments as input: the first
being a tibble, data.frame, or matrix of covariates, and the second being a
vector of predicted individual-level treatment effects. Moreover, the
function should return a list. At a minimum, this list should contain one
element named \code{fit} that is a model object that can be used to output the
leaf membership indices for each observation via
\code{predict(student_model, x, type = 'node')}. In general, we recommend
using the default "rpart".}

\item{rpart_control}{A list of control parameters for the \code{rpart} algorithm.
See \code{? rpart.control} for details. Used only if \code{student_model} is "rpart".}

\item{rpart_prune}{Method for pruning the tree. Default is \code{"none"}.
Options are \code{"none"}, \code{"min"}, and \code{"1se"}. If \code{"min"},
the tree is pruned using the complexity threshold which minimizes the
cross-validation error. If \code{"1se"}, the tree is pruned using the
largest complexity threshold which yields a cross-vaidation error within
one standard error of the minimum. If \code{"none"}, the tree is not
pruned.}

\item{nfolds_crossfit}{Number of folds in cross-fitting procedure.
If \code{teacher_model} is "causal_forest", the default is 1 (no cross-fitting
is performed). Otherwise, the default is 2 (one fold for training the
teacher model and one fold for estimating the individual-level treatment effects).}

\item{nreps_crossfit}{Number of repetitions of the cross-fitting procedure.
If \code{teacher_model} is "causal_forest", the default is 1 (no cross-fitting
is performed). Otherwise, the default is 50.}

\item{B_stability}{Number of bootstrap samples to use in evaluating stability
diagnostics. Default is 100. Stability diagnostics are only performed if
\code{student_model} is an \code{rpart} object. If \code{B_stability} is 0, no stability
diagnostics are performed.}

\item{max_depth_stability}{Maximum depth of the decision tree used in
evaluating stability diagnostics. If \code{NULL}, the default is
max(4, max depth of fitted student model).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the \code{teacher_model} function.}
}
\value{
